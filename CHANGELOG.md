# Changelog

All notable changes to Dazyflow are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

The repository, Go module, and daemon binary are named `dazyflow` / `dzd`.
Versions here correspond to git tags `X.Y.Z` on
[git.sr.ht/~klahr/dazyflow](https://git.sr.ht/~klahr/dazyflow). The running
version is stamped into the binary at build time and surfaced on
`GET /api/v1` (the `build` block) and in the web UI's account menu.

Releasing: move the entries below from `[Unreleased]` under a new
`[X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` heading, commit, then run `make patch` (or
`minor` / `major`) to cut the annotated tag against that commit.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Licensed the project under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 or
  later (AGPL-3.0-or-later); added `LICENSE` and a README license section.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-08

Initial release.

### Added

- **Flow engine.** Graph-based flows with conditional branching, fan-out
  (`for_each`), reusable subgraphs, and per-node retry policies. Runs are
  persisted and observable end to end.
- **Connectors.** Built-in integrations for HTTP, Postgres, Slack, Gmail,
  GitHub, Git, Notion, Google Sheets, and Excel, plus shell and
  transform/value utility nodes.
- **AI steps.** Claude-backed LLM nodes for generation and transformation
  inside a flow.
- **Triggers.** Start flows from inbound webhooks or timezone-aware cron
  schedules.
- **Web UI.** Visual flow builder and run viewer, with light and dark
  themes.
- **MCP server.** Exposes the connector catalog so an LLM agent can
  discover, compose, and run flows.
- **Control plane.** gRPC API with the `dzctl` CLI, plus a REST surface
  documented by an OpenAPI spec under `/api/v1`.
- **Auth & multi-tenancy.** Organizations, role-based access control, TOTP
  two-factor auth, invitations, and a platform super-admin role.
- **Secrets.** Master-key-encrypted storage for connector credentials.
- **Deployment.** Docker Compose stack (daemon + Postgres) with a boot
  guard that refuses to start on insecure defaults.
- **Versioning.** Version metadata stamped into the binary at build time,
  surfaced on `GET /api/v1` and in the web UI; `make bin`/`major`/`minor`/
  `patch`/`upgrade` release targets.
